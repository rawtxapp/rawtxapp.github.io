Today, we are releasing the iOS version of the rawtx wallet, a mobile lightning network wallet for Bitcoin.
Here's a demo sending 20 satoshis from Android to iOS instantly over lightning network: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kftCcpKzlA0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kftCcpKzlA0).

In addition to the iOS release, we've released the source code on github.
