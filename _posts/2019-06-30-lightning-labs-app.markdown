**tl;dr** after a long wait, lightning labs finally released their own mobile
wallets, so we will be removing rawtx from the app store, code will still be
available on github.

You can see their announcement [here](https://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2019/06/19/mobile-app.html). It looks really nice and I would highly recommend
checking it out.

With that, we're going to remove the rawtx app from the store and you can still
get the code from github to experiment with if you're interested. We're going
to focus on other projects related to lightning. If you have any suggestions or
things you would like to see built, send us an email!
